TODO:
- put trick back (will require tricksWon to be Card[][][])
- record who played what on current trick
- show who played last hand
- move play trick button below cards
- run http (not s) server on port 80 that simply redirects all requests to https
- new initial screen: spectate or join game (if seats are available)
- play requires password
- kick player if idle for 5 minutes
- kick spectator if idle for 30 minutes?

- make pass card UI cleaner:
    - get rid of all the buttons below each card
    - just cards are shown initially, visually identical to play phase
    - tap a card to bring up the same buttons right on top of the card (which becomes faded)
        - pass left
        - pass to partner
        - pass right
        - cancel
    - hitting cancel (or the element losing focus?) makes the buttons go away again
    - If a card has been chosen to be passed, it appears faded with a button superimposed on its middle saying "take back"

- new server messages:
    - welcome: number of players/available spots, number of spectators, game in progress?
    - you're about to be kicked
    - you've been kicked
    - all spots are taken, you can't join
    - password correct/incorrect

- new client messages:
    - join game
    - spectate
    - I'm still alive (to prevent being kicked)

- spectator view
    - move client UI guts (except loading/disconnected) to PlayerUI
    - add SpectatorUI
    - add SpectatorStateView
    - replace ClientUI with join-or-spectate screen
    - when socket first connects, send welcome (see above)

- notifications
    - vertical list of items that slowly vanished or can be dismissed
    - only stored in client ui state, generated from server messages
    - examples: 
    
- new phases:
    - deal phase
        - actions:
            - take first deal
            - take second deal (and automatically advance to pass phase?)
    - review pass phase?
        - each player is shown the cards they were passed
        - actions
            - ready to play
